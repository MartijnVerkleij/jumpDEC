jumpDEC
=======
jumpDEC is a collaboration project between a duo of Raspberry-Pi developers and DEC-FPGA developers, to design a simple room-based platformer. The game will have similarities with the popular game N.

Responsibilities are divided as such:
- The FPGA does all physics rendering and provides location data of the player to the Pi. It also processes keyboard input.
- The Pi is responsible for doing visual rendering.
