=======
jumpDEC is a collaboration project between a duo of Raspberry-Pi developers and DEC-FPGA developers, to design a simple room-based platformer. 

Responsibilities are divided as such:
- The FPGA does all physics rendering and provides location data of the player to the Pi.
- The Pi is responsible for processing keyboard input and visual rendering of the game.
